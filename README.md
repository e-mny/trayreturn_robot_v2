# Improved Tray Return Robot

## 📙 Overview 

[Our Blog](https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/ps9888-2021-g15/)

This project involves the development of a tray-return robot designed to operate in food courts. 
The robot autonomously navigates, stops when there are nearby obstacles or people. Patrons may leave their trays on the robot, which will then return trays to the dishwashing station.

## 💯 Features

- **Line Tracking**: The robot follows a predefined path using line tracking sensors.
- **Weight Sensors**: Determines whether to proceed to the unloading station or continue its loop based on the weight of trays.
- **Proximity Sensors**: Stops the robot when it detects nearby motion or obstructions to prevent collisions.
- **Linear Actuators**: Lifts the tray rack to pick up trays and puts them down when unloading.

## 🤖 Hardware Components 

- **Microcontroller**: Raspberry Pi or any suitable microcontroller.
- **Line Tracking Sensors**: For following a predefined path.
- **Weight Sensors (Load Cells)**: To measure the weight of the trays.
- **Proximity Sensors (Ultrasonic Sensors)**: For obstacle detection.
- **Linear Actuators**: To lift and lower the tray rack.
- **Motors and Motor Drivers**: For robot movement.
- **Power Supply**: Batteries or a suitable power source.
- **Chassis**: The physical structure of the robot.

## 💻 Software Components 

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Development Environment**: Any Python-compatible IDE
- **Libraries**: RPi.GPIO for GPIO control, other relevant libraries for sensor and actuator integration.

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup 

### 📋 Prerequisites
